= Expr Module

The `expr` module has been remove, and replaced with an equivalent
`%{expr:...}` in the xref:xlat/builtin.adoc[built-in expansions].  The
parameters to the `%{expr:...}` is an
xref:reference:unlang/expression.adoc[Unlang expression].

Most people should see no change in functionality.  However, the new
expressions offer significantly more operators, and work on more data
types.
