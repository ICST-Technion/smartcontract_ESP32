This is a simple server for the MS SoH requests generated by the
peap module - see "raddb/mods-available/eap" for more info

Requests are ONLY passed through the authorize section, and cannot
current be proxied (in any event, the radius attributes used are
internal).



client NAKed our request for SoH - not supported, or turned off
client replied; check something - this is a local policy issue!

== Default Configuration

```
server soh-server {
	recv Access-Request {
		if (&SoH-Supported == no) {
			&control.Auth-Type = Accept
		}
		else {
			if (&SoH-MS-Windows-Health-Status =~ /antivirus (warn|error) /) {
				&control.Auth-Type = Reject
				&reply.Reply-Message = "You must have antivirus enabled & installed!"
			}
			else {
				&control.Auth-Type = Accept
			}
		}
	}
}
```
